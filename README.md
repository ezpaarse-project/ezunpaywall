- [API Graphql](#API-graphql)

## Prerequisites

The tools you need to let ezunpaywall run are :
* docker
* docker-compose
* npm (for development)
* a linux box or VM (eg: Ubuntu)
* unpaywall data measured about 130Gb it is necessary to provide the necessary place on the hard drive

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezunpaywall 
```
## Deployment
### Setup environment

Create an environment file named `ezunpaywall.local.env.sh` and export the following environment variables. You can then source `ezunpaywall.env.sh` , which contains a set of predefined variables and is overriden by `ezunpaywall.local.env.sh`.
#### Unpaywall

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| API_KEY_UPW | api key to access weekly unpaywall updates |
| API_KEY_USERS | api key to give to users to authorize them to request on ezunpaywall |
| API_KEY_ADMIN | api key to run unpaywall updates |
#### Mail

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
|Â NODE_CONFIG | make tls and secure of mail (only in developement) |
| EZUNPAYWALL_SMTP_HOST | host of the SMTP server |
| EZUNPAYWALL_SMTP_PORT | port of the SMTP server |
| EZUNPAYWALL_NOTIFICATIONS_SENDER | the sender for emails issued by ezunpaywall |
| EZUNPAYWALL_NOTIFICATIONS_RECEIVERS | recipients of the recent activity email |
#### Elastic

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| ELASTICSEARCH_PORT | elastic port |
| ELASTICSEARCH_HOST | elastic url |
| ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME | elastic user |
| ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD | elastic password |

### Configuration (optionnal)

this part is not obligatory, but it can be interesting in a pre-production environment
### Adjust system configuration for Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch has some [system requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/system-config.html) that you should check.

To avoid memory exceptions, you may have to increase mmaps count. Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add the following line :

```ini
# configuration needed for elastic search
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Then apply the changes : 
```bash
sysctl -p
```
### Setup Elastic certificates

For each node in the cluster, add certificates in `elasticsearch/config/certificates/`. Kibana should also have certificates in `kibana/config/certificates`. If you don't have them yet, you can generate them by following these steps :

  - Open the `config/certs` directory.
  - Create an [instances.yml](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/certutil.html#certutil-silent) file (an example file is available).

  - Run `docker-compose -f create-certs.yml up`.
  - A bundle.zip archive is created, it must be decompressed in the certificates folder.
  ```bash
  unzip bundle.zip -d ../elasticsearch/certificates/
  ```

### Start/Stop/Status

Before you start ezunpaywall, make sure all necessary environment variables are set.

```bash
# Start ezunpaywall as daemon
docker-compose up -d

# Stop ezunpaywall
docker-compose stop

# Get the status of ezunpaywall services
docker-compose ps
```
## Development
### Install

```bash
npm i
```
### Start

Before you start ezunpaywall, make sure all necessary environment variables are set.

```bash
# Build ezunpaywall 
docker-compose run --rm elastic chown -R elasticsearch /usr/share/elasticsearch/ 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml build

# Start ezunpaywall as daemon
docker-compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d

# Stop ezunpaywall
docker-compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml stop

# Get the status of ezunpaywall services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml ps
```

```bash
# start test
npm run test
```
## Data update 

You can update your data via update snapshots provided by unpaywall on a weekly basis (if you have API key).
You can directly use the update routes or use the [ezunpaywall command](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/node-ezunpaywall)
### Data update API

`POST "/update/:name`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | PARAMS | name of file that the server has already downloaded |
| offset | QUERY (optionnal) | first line insertion, by default, we start with the first |
| limit | QUERY (optionnal)| last line insertion by default, we have no limit |

Insert the content of files that the server has already downloaded (file in .gz format). offset and limit are the variables to designate from which line to insert and from which line to stop.

`POST "/update`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startDate | QUERY (optionnal) | period start date at format YYYY-mm-dd |
| endDate | QUERY (optionnal) | period end date at format YYYY-mm-dd |

Downloads update files offered by unpaywall.
- If there are no `start` and` end` attributes, It will execute
the download and the insertion of the most recent update file.
- If there are the `start` and` end` attributes, It will execute the download and the insertion of the update files between the given period.
- If there is the `start` attribute, It will execute the download and
the insertion of the update files between the` start` date and the current date.
## API Graphql
